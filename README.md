### 50-Word Description
This is a description of who I am. I work at the pool as hard as I can every time. I go to school in Edmonton except for now which is online every morning. A lot of people think I'm in university but I'm actually in high school which I find very interesting. I personally feel very sad that I'm not in a classroom at school.

### 50-Word Description of my Career Plans
I am very interested in engineering. But I don't think that I will have the marks for it. I have been trying very hard to understand the physics of it but I guess I'm not their yet. But that doesn't mean that I wont give up in school. In fact it makes me more motivated to try harder and harder.
